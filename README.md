# ucbmlai-a51-driver-coupon-analysis

This repository analyzes a UCI survey dataset to understand which drivers are likely to accept time-limited coupons (restaurant, coffee house, bar, take-away, etc.). The project applies exploratory data analysis, visualization, and simple probabilistic modeling to identify factors that correlate with coupon acceptance.

Summary of findings
- Coupon acceptance correlates with situational context (destination alignment and time of day) and coupon type — for example, bar coupons show lower acceptance when children are present.
- After cleaning, the dataset contains ~12,000 observations and 25 features; the analysis removes duplicates and drops a column (`car`) that had ~99% missing values.

Notebook
- The full analysis is in the Jupyter notebook: `prompt.ipynb` (root). Consider moving and renaming it to `notebooks/assignment5-driver-coupon-analysis.ipynb` for clarity.

Quick start
1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install minimal dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install --user pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyterlab
```

3. Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter lab prompt.ipynb
```

Data
- Raw source: `data/coupons.csv` (committed). A cleaned version `data/coupons_cleaned.csv` is also present (generated by the notebook).
- Recommendation: organize data into `data/raw/` and `data/processed/`. If you want to avoid committing derived data, move `coupons_cleaned.csv` to `data/processed/` and add that directory to `.gitignore`.

Repository structure (suggested)
- `README.md` — this file
- `prompt.ipynb` — analysis notebook (consider moving to `notebooks/`)
- `data/` — dataset files (`raw/` and `processed/` recommended)
- `images/` — exported figures
- `src/` — (optional) helper scripts for cleaning/plotting
- `tests/` — (optional) pytest tests

Recommendations & next steps
- Convert `prompt.ipynb` to a standard Jupyter notebook format (it currently contains VS Code cell wrappers). Open and re-save in JupyterLab to ensure compatibility with other notebook viewers and Binder.
- Add a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` to pin package versions for reproducibility.
- Move notebooks to `notebooks/` and processed data to `data/processed/` for clarity.
- Add a short `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `notebooks/README.md` describing how to run the analysis and regenerate `coupons_cleaned.csv`.

Contact
- If you want, I can (a) move and re-save the notebook to standard `.ipynb`, (b) add `requirements.txt`, and (c) reorganize the `data/` directory. Which would you like me to do next?

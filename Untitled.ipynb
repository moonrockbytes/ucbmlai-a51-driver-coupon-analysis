    "# **Driver Coupon Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository analyzes a UCI survey dataset to understand which drivers are likely to accept time-limited coupons (restaurant, coffee house, bar, take-away, etc.). The project applies exploratory data analysis, visualization, and simple probabilistic modeling to identify factors that correlate with coupon acceptance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**High-Level Summary of Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dataset & Cleaning: Original dataset 12,684 rows × 26 cols. Removed 74 duplicate rows, dropped the car column (99% missing), and dropped remaining rows with NaNs. Cleaned data saved to coupons_cleaned.csv (final ~12,007 rows × 25 cols).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overall Acceptance: 56.8% of observations accepted a coupon (≈6,825/12,007) vs 43.2% who did not — an acceptance lead of ~13.6%\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coupon Distribution: Coupon types are unevenly distributed (e.g., Coffee House and Restaurant(<20) are common). Raw-count analyses can be biased by these frequencies and should account for per-type prevalence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Temperature / Weather: Temperature is tri-modal (≈30°F, 55°F, 80°F) and shows no clear visual relationship with coupon acceptance — temperature is not a strong driver.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Bar Coupon Acceptance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Bar coupons are less likely to be accepted overall (≈41.2% acceptance for bar coupons; 785 accepted vs 1,121 not accepted, total 1,906).\n",
    "      \n",
    "    - Frequency matters: drivers who visit bars >3/month accept bar coupons at ~76.2% vs ~37.2% for ≤3/month — a very large effect.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    - Demographics amplify effect: drivers who visit bars ≥1/month and are >25 years old accept at ~69.0% vs ~33.7% for others.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    - Drivers who visit bars ≥1/month, travel without kids, and are non-farming occupations have much higher acceptance — useful targeting signal.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Coffee House Coupon Acceptance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Overall nearly even acceptance / rejection.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    - Acceptance increases with historical Coffee House visit frequency (positive frequency effect).\n",
    " \n",
    "    - Passenger type matters: Alone and Partner show higher acceptance; Kid(s) shows the lowest.\n",
    " \n",
    "    - Route/convenience matters: acceptance is higher when the coupon venue is on the same direction/route as the trip.\n",
    " \n",
    "    - Destination also shifts acceptance (discretionary/no-urgent trips show higher acceptance).\n",
    "    \n",
    "Final Product depicting the findings that highlights the differences between customers who did and did not accept the coupons in available here: [Final Report](docs/final_analysis_report.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook\n",

    "# ucbmlai-a51-driver-coupon-analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains an exploratory analysis of a survey-style dataset used to study drivers' likelihood of accepting time-limited coupons (restaurant, coffee house, bar, take-away, etc.). The project focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and straightforward subgroup analyses to surface factors correlated with coupon acceptance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick Links**\n",
    "- **Assignment instructions:** `assignment_instructions.md`\n",
    "- **Data dictionary:** `coupons_data_dictionary.md`\n",

    "**Quick Start**\n",
    "- **Create a virtual environment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv .venv\n",
    "source .venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "**What’s included**\n",
    "- **`prompt.ipynb`**: analysis notebook containing data loading, cleaning steps (deduplication, dropping `car` column, dropping rows with remaining NaNs), EDA plots, and findings. Note: earlier versions contained VS Code cell wrappers; if you experience rendering issues, open the notebook in JupyterLab and re-save it to standardize the format.\n",
    "- **`src/describe_columns.py`**: small helper script that prints per-column unique counts, missing counts, and top value frequencies for a CSV file.\n",
    "- **`assignment_instructions.md`**: extracted assignment instructions and tasks.\n",
    "- **`coupons_data_dictionary.md`**: data dictionary describing each column in `coupons.csv`.\n",
    "- **`images/`**: exported figures generated by the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage notes & recommendations**\n",
    "- **Relative links:** The notebook and markdown files use relative links (e.g., `assignment_instructions.md`) so previews in VS Code and GitHub will open targets correctly. If you move files into `docs/` or another folder, update links accordingly.\n",
    "- **Reproducibility:** Add a `requirements.txt` (e.g., `pip freeze > requirements.txt`) or an `environment.yml` to pin dependency versions for reproducible runs.\n",
    "- **Notebook portability:** If your `prompt.ipynb` includes VS Code-wrapped cells, open and re-save it in JupyterLab to produce a standard `.ipynb` compatible with Binder and other viewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggested next steps**\n",
    "- Move notebooks to `notebooks/` and processed data to `data/processed/` for clearer separation of raw/derived artifacts.\n",
    "- Add `requirements.txt` and a short `CONTRIBUTING.md` with commands to reproduce the cleaned dataset and regenerate figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want, I can also (a) convert and save `prompt.ipynb` to a standard Jupyter format in `notebooks/`, (b) create a `requirements.txt`, and (c) move the processed data into `data/processed/`. Tell me which of these you want me to do next.\n"
